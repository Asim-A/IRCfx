# IRCfx - ON HOLD UNTILL THE BEGINNING OF 2020 #
## Description: ##
##### IRCfx is a project of mine that includes a client-side aswell as a sever side. In simple terms, it's a chat application. The goal is to develope a multithreaded backend. Each thread would support async code. When utilized properly it would maximize server cpu resources and provide fast and efficient client end to end messaging. It is going to use protobuff
#
#### Goals: 
- [x] Protobuff
- [x] Multithreaded
- [ ] Asynchronous
- [ ] Client-side (Javafx)
- [ ] Testing


#### I have yet to decide whether I want the backend architecture to be multithreaded and asynchronous. I have to conduct tests to see if it's even worth it. The true main goal is to explore more of java.nio.
